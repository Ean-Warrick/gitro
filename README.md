Fun fact: GitRo was uploaded to GitHub from Roblox Studio using GitRo itself.

Disclaimer: GitRo only works with Roblox Folder, Scripts, LocalScripts, and ModuleScripts. You can't push or pull any other Roblox object types (currently a WIP feature).

GitRo is not meant to be installed into Roblox Studio using this repository. The official Roblox plugin link will be put here when it is published. The repository lacks the user GUI that the plugin requires.

GitRo utilizes GitHub's latest (as of publishing) API version (2022-11-28)
